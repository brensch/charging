I'm building an EV charging service that needs a webpage UI for customers to scan a qr code or enter a plug number, put their payment details in, and then turn on and off the plug that they will plug their car into.

I've mocked the pages I will need in figma here: https://www.figma.com/file/Ebbx4TJyFY839zVAqtPkrl/Magic-Charge?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=oEgvgBxYuN12UXKk-1

I would like you to use neubrutalism in the design, I have made a start but I would like you to finish it properly. Please feel free to rethink most of the elements, I have mainly put together this figma to detail the pages I will need, and a rough vibe.

Please let me know how much it would cost for you to complete the pages outlined properly, with the areas that are just text descriptions fully fleshed out.
