- 1 unit, probably beans
- for each reading chunk, do a calculation of how many beans were used
- add a bean usage record for every user owning each plug at that time
- update users bean total (to avoid huge number of reads)
- if below threshold in user's settings, automatically bill them if topup enabled
- if credit at zero (no top up), issue turnoff command.
